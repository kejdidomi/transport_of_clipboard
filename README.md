# transport_of_clipboard
A way to "copy" in one computer and "paste" on the other
## Inspiration
This is actually a very dumb idea. I have 2 computers in my home and sometimes I want to transfer code from my laptop to my desktop pc, 
so i thought wouldn't it be nice if I could hit "copy" in my laptop and somehow hit "paste" in my pc and it would work that way. Now I am sure there must be a ton
of different ways to do this that could be easier or more efficient, but I wanted also to learn and h=get used to socket programming, and I 
thought this would be at least useful to some extent.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on both devices
- PySimpleGUI module: can be installed with the command `pip install pysimplegui` in cmd (sidenote this is only tested in Windows for now)
- At least 2 computers (we are gonna call them COMPUTER1 and COMPUTER2)
## Limitations
- You can send only text so no images or files.
- There is a limit to the length of the text you can send. By default you can only send **100 000 bytes (100 000 characters)**, although it can be changed.
## How to Use
1. Download transport.py file in COMPUTER1 and COMPUTER2
2. Edit transport.py
    1.
